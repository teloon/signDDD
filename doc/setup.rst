Environment setup
=================

For the CPU-based version, the only environment needed is **python**. The python
version should be at least 2.5 because of using ``hashlib``.

For the GPU-based version, additionally the **Nvidia driver** and **CUDA** platform need
to be setup. Currently this version of program is only tested in CUDA *4.0.17*.
