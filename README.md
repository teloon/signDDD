signDDD
==========

signDDD is a sentence-level near Duplicate Document Detection project, which is based on the idea of [signature file](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signature_file).

By optimizing the hashcodes of the words in the vocabulary, the method will achieve better precision. Refer to [Learning hash codes for efficient content reuse detection](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2348339).

Besides, this project implements both GPU-based and CPU-based hamming distance computing.
